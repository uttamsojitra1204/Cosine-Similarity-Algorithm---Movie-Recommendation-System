# Cosine-Similarity-Algorithm---Movie-Recommendation-System

Movie Recommendation System

=> How It Works
- Data Preprocessing: Loads and filters movie data for columns like genres, keywords, and other relevant textual fields.
- Vectorization: Uses TF-IDF Vectorizer to create a vectorized form of textual data.
- Similarity Computation: Calculates cosine similarity between movies based on vectorized data, helping to find movies with similar content.
- Recommendation Generation: Matches the movie title inputted by the user and recommends movies similar in content and genre.

=> Conclusion
- This Movie Recommendation System efficiently suggests movies based on content similarity, using NLP and cosine similarity techniques to match genres, keywords, and overviews. It provides relevant recommendations and serves as a foundation for more advanced recommendation engines, with potential future improvements like adding user ratings, collaborative filtering, or deep learning-based methods for enhanced accuracy.
